# 🎮 Intelligent NPC System for RPGs (MTech Thesis Prototype)

This is the early-stage prototype of my **M.Tech AI thesis project**, aimed at building a **context-aware, memory-augmented, visually grounded NPC system** for open-world RPGs.

The goal is to design a **non-player character (NPC)** that:
- Talks naturally using language models (LLMs)
- Understands its environment using computer vision
- Remembers past events and evolves over time
- Narrates lore dynamically to enhance storytelling and immersion

## 🧠 Thesis Focus

**Title:** *LLM-Augmented Context-Aware NPC for Immersive Storytelling in Open-World Games*  
**Key Objectives:**
- Integrate **LLM + Vision + Memory** in a real-time interactive NPC
- Design a hybrid memory system (short- and long-term)
- Enable the NPC to narrate **dynamic lore** about game-world objects
- Ensure scalability and real-time player interaction in Unity
